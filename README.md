## About

**Ghostshell** is a fork of [Ghostty Terminal Emulator](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) created on **July 5, 2025** as an experimental project for **Arch Linux + NVIDIA + Wayland** users. This fork differentiates itself by being optimized for **NVIDIA GPUs**, built with **Zig 0.15**, and designed for **home lab environments**.

This is an **experimental fork** that focuses specifically on maximum performance for NVIDIA users and power users who demand cutting-edge speed. While there are many excellent terminal emulators available, Ghostshell serves as a testing ground for specialized optimizations.

**Fork Maintainer:** Christopher Kelley (GhostKellz) <ckelley@ghostkellz.sh>  
**Organization:** CK Technology  
**Original Project:** [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) by Mitchell Hashimoto (@mitchellh)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This is an independent experimental fork. For production use, consider the original [Ghostty project](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty). See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for complete attribution details.

Ghostshell provides:
- **Pure Zig**: Built with Zig 0.15 for maximum performance and memory safety
- **Pure Speed**: NVIDIA GPU-accelerated rendering with conditional VSync and triple buffering
- **Pure NVIDIA**: First-class support for GeForce and Quadro graphics cards
- **Home Lab Ready**: Optimized for server monitoring, SSH sessions, and system administration
